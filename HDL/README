The fifo is a dual clock fifo, meaning it has different frequencies of writing and reading.
It uses a gray code pointer for comparing full and empty scenarios and a binary counter to index into the memory.

The write pointer always points to the next word to be written; therefore, on reset, both pointers are set to zero, 
which also happens to be the next FIFO word location to be written. On a FIFO-write operation, the memory location that is pointed to by the
write pointer is written, and then the write pointer is incremented to point to the next location to be written.

A gray code pointer is used because it is easier to synchronise into the write and read domains.
The read pointer is synchronised into the write domain using a two flip flop synchroniser and is 
compared with the next write pointer to determine the full condition.

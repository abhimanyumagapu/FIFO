The testbench generates random values of winc and rinc- basically the write and read enable signals.
It also generates random data to be written into the fifo.
The read and write speeds are different.
Once data has been written, it is pushed into a dynamic array, where it is popped out when the data is read.
The read data is compared with the popped data to determine a match.
The error count is displayed at the end.



The testbench is still a little buggy, if you have any recommendations to improve the tb, please feel free to create a pull request.
